# details.  The web page <http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/AccessRestrictions>

# Note that "restrict" applies to both servers and clients, so a configuration
# that might be intended to block requests from certain clients could also end
# up blocking replies from your own upstream servers.

# By default, exchange time with everybody, but don't allow configuration.
